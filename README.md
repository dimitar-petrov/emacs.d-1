# About
My `emacs` configuration.

# Motivation
1. Make emacs fits my way of working.
2. Be really effective at coding and writing.
3. Share my emacs configuration.

# Tests

To run the `tests` perform with `ert`, run the command:

	make test

To test the whole emacs setting, run the command:

	make test_all

Install the pre-commit hook, so that the tests are always running:

    cp pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
